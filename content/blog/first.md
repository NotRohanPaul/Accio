```java
Rome wasnt built in a day,neither will this be
```

After getting fed up of my very colorful `template` React page, and procastinating for more than 2 months on building a blog page , today is when I finally start it.
<br>
Thought of making a theme of own,something minimilist, from scratch as it would be a great learning experience with `sass` , ssg's and templating library.
Since this is <br> going to take long, So a request :pray: to reader , do visit the page frequently as you might see great some changes.Using a refernce of many blogs which I admire
<br>(would reference them in future),and probably would take a lot of help along the way, and hoping to make this something great.
<br>
